generations:
  - name: "First Generation (U13)"
    start_year: 1993
    end_year: 1997
    description: "The original Nissan Altima was introduced as a replacement for the Stanza in Nissan's lineup, positioned between the compact Sentra and flagship Maxima sedans. Built at Nissan's Smyrna, Tennessee plant, it featured a rounded, conservative design typical of early 1990s Japanese sedans. Powered by a 2.4L KA24DE four-cylinder engine producing 150 horsepower, paired with either a 5-speed manual or 4-speed automatic transmission driving the front wheels. The interior offered seating for five with standard amenities including air conditioning, power windows, and a stereo system. Trim levels ranged from the base XE to the luxury-oriented GLE with leather seating, alloy wheels, and additional power accessories. The first-generation Altima established itself as a value-oriented midsize sedan with a focus on reliability and comfort, though it lacked the refinement and features of some competitors."

  - name: "Second Generation (L30)"
    start_year: 1998
    end_year: 2001
    description: "The second-generation Altima maintained similar dimensions to its predecessor but featured updated styling with a more aerodynamic profile and refined details. The 2.4L four-cylinder engine continued with minor improvements, still producing 150 horsepower, paired with the same transmission options. Interior space was slightly improved, with better materials and enhanced ergonomics. New features included available side airbags, an improved audio system, and refined suspension tuning for better ride quality. Special editions included the sporty SE and luxury-oriented GLE models, offering distinctive appearance elements and additional features. This generation represented an evolutionary approach, maintaining the Altima's position as a value alternative in the midsize sedan segment while addressing some refinement issues from the first generation."

  - name: "Third Generation (L31)"
    start_year: 2002
    end_year: 2006
    description: "The third-generation Altima marked a significant advancement, growing substantially in size and moving firmly into the midsize sedan category. Built on Nissan's new FF-L platform shared with the Maxima, it featured more aggressive styling with a distinctive front fascia and athletic proportions. Engine options expanded to include a base 2.5L four-cylinder producing 175 horsepower and an optional 3.5L VQ35DE V6 generating 240 horsepower, paired with either a 5-speed manual or 4-speed automatic transmission (later a 5-speed automatic for V6 models). The interior offered significantly more space with improved materials and design, including available features such as a Bose audio system, leather seating, and a power sunroof. The SE-R performance variant joined the lineup in 2005, featuring a 260 horsepower version of the V6, sport-tuned suspension, 18-inch wheels, and unique interior and exterior styling elements. This generation established the Altima as a more distinctive, performance-oriented alternative to competitors like the Honda Accord and Toyota Camry, dramatically increasing its market presence and sales volume."

  - name: "Fourth Generation (L32)"
    start_year: 2007
    end_year: 2012
    description: "The fourth-generation Altima refined the successful formula of its predecessor with evolutionary styling updates, enhanced technology, and improved efficiency. Available in both sedan and coupe body styles (the latter introduced in 2008), it maintained similar dimensions to the third generation but with more sophisticated design elements. Powertrain options continued with refined versions of the 2.5L four-cylinder (175 hp) and 3.5L V6 (270 hp), now paired with either a 6-speed manual or continuously variable transmission (CVT) that helped improve fuel economy. The interior featured higher quality materials, improved sound insulation, and available technology including Bluetooth connectivity, push-button ignition, and a backup camera. Safety features expanded to include stability control, traction control, and available features like blind spot monitoring. The Altima Hybrid joined the lineup from 2007-2011, combining the 2.5L engine with an electric motor and technology licensed from Toyota for a total system output of 198 horsepower and substantially improved fuel economy. This generation maintained the Altima's strong market position with its balance of performance, efficiency, and value, consistently ranking among the bestselling midsize sedans in the United States."

  - name: "Fifth Generation (L33)"
    start_year: 2013
    end_year: 2018
    description: "The fifth-generation Altima featured more dramatic styling with a bold front grille, sculpted body sides, and a coupe-like roofline, though it was offered only as a sedan with the coupe discontinued. Built on a revised version of the previous platform, it was lighter and more aerodynamic while maintaining similar dimensions. The 2.5L four-cylinder was heavily revised, now producing 182 horsepower, while the 3.5L V6 continued with 270 horsepower, both paired exclusively with an improved continuously variable transmission. The interior received a significant upgrade with higher quality materials, a more contemporary design, and advanced technology including NissanConnect infotainment system with navigation and mobile apps capability. Available features expanded to include remote engine start, dual-zone climate control, and heated steering wheel. Safety technology advanced substantially with the introduction of Nissan Safety Shield including forward collision warning, blind spot monitoring, and rear cross-traffic alert. A mid-cycle refresh in 2016 brought updated exterior styling, enhanced interior materials, and expanded availability of active safety features. The fifth-generation Altima continued as a strong competitor in the midsize segment, particularly appealing to those seeking a combination of expressive styling, good fuel economy, and value pricing."

  - name: "Sixth Generation (L34)"
    start_year: 2019
    end_year: null
    description: "The current Altima represents a comprehensive redesign featuring more sophisticated styling with a lower, wider stance, Nissan's V-motion grille design, and sleeker proportions. Built on a new platform, it offers improved structural rigidity, reduced noise, and enhanced handling dynamics. A significant powertrain innovation is the introduction of Nissan's variable compression turbo (VC-Turbo) 2.0L four-cylinder engine generating 248 horsepower as the V6 replacement on higher trims, while the base 2.5L four-cylinder was redesigned to produce 188 horsepower. Both engines pair with a continuously variable transmission. For the first time, all-wheel drive became available, though only with the 2.5L engine. The interior features a more premium design with a 'gliding wing' dashboard housing an 8-inch touchscreen infotainment system with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto compatibility. Advanced safety technology includes standard Nissan Safety Shield 360 with automatic emergency braking, pedestrian detection, lane departure warning, and automatic high beams, with available ProPILOT Assist providing semi-autonomous driving capability on highways. Special variants include the sporty SR with unique styling elements and the premium Platinum trim with upgraded leather upholstery and additional luxury features. A minor update for 2023 brought revised styling and feature adjustments. The sixth-generation Altima competes in the declining midsize sedan segment by offering distinctive technology, optional all-wheel drive, and comprehensive safety features, helping maintain its relevance as consumer preferences shift toward crossovers and SUVs."
